# Compressor/Decompressor in C
Made in October 2022 (7th grade)

This is a compressor/decompressor that takes in a directory of files merges it into one file. It doesn't actually compress the files,
but it will remove the need to use a directory. It is like the equivalent of tar. The decompressor, likewise, will take the compressed file and
split it into the directory and the seperate files.
