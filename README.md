# Archiving tool in C
Made in October 2022 (7th grade)

An archive is a collection of files and metadata combined into one file.  

This is an archiving tool that takes in a directory of files and merges it into one file. Many systems don't allow you to send directories, such as gmail. It is like the equivalent of tar. The dearchiver, likewise, will take the archived file and split it into the directory and the separate files.
